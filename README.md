# Coastal-tourism-safety-and-suitability-app'
Developed a mobile/web application called CoastalGuard that assists tourists in identifying safe and suitable coastal locations for travel, based on real-time data, safety parameters, and environmental conditions. The system was designed to promote safe coastal tourism by providing users with updated information on weather, sea conditions, crowd density, pollution levels, and local guidelines.

The app allows users to:

View suitability scores for different beaches

Get alerts for dangerous weather or high tides

Access safety guidelines and emergency contact info

Explore tourist-friendly features like accessibility, cleanliness, and available amenities

Technologies used include Java, XML, Firebase (for Android) or HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL (for web-based systems). The application integrates API data (such as weather or tidal data) to make dynamic recommendations and alerts.
